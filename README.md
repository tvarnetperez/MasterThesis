# MasterThesis

In this repository sections of the code for my Master of Statistics Thesis "Peer and parental attachment: measurement invariance and protective role for sexual victimization in Belgian youth" are included. Because of sensible information contained, original dataset is available upon request with Prof. Laura Vandenbosch.

Scripts are currently being cleaned and checked for consistency due to the two versions used in the thesis (3.6.3 and 4.0.2).
