# MasterThesis

In this repository sections of the code for my Master of Statistics Thesis "Peer and parental attachment: measurement invariance and protective role for sexual victimization in Belgian youth" are included. Original dataset is available upon request with Prof. Laura Vandenbosch.

Scripts are undergoing modifications in order to be consistent with R version 4.0.2, as the thesis was conducted under two versions (3.6.3 being the other).
